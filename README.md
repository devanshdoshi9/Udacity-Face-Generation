# Udacity Face Generation

## About
This project will allow you to generate deep fake human faces. The faces of people created by the model don't actually exist but are fakes generated by the model. We use a Generative Adverserial Network (GAN) which mainly consists of 2 components: Generator, responsible for generating fake images and Discriminator, responsible for distinguishing generated images from real images.
